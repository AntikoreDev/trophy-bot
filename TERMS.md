# Terms of Service
This software is provided "as is" without any warranty. Use at your own risk.

**To clarify,** these terms only apply to the bot's service provided by me, [AntikoreDev](https://www.antikore.dev/) (that means these are only applied for the actual use on the official bot). Any self-hosted versions or forks (thus, also self-hosted) are exempt to these terms **at my own operational level**. However, the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) should be still applied on any forks or self-hosted versions of the bot, as specified by its own conditions.<br>
I'm not responsible for any wrong use of the bot on forks or self-hosted versions.

By using [Trophy Bot](https://github.com/AntikoreDev/trophy-bot), you're implicitly agreeing with these terms, otherwise you should stop using it.

## List of terms
* We reserve the right to revoke access to the bot at any time for any reason without prior notice.
* We reserve the right to remove any content generated with the bot at any time if needed without prior notice.
* Any use of this bot for any illegal and/or malicious behavior may result in revoking your rights to it.
* We are not responsible of any malicious use of the bot done by you or anyone else.
* While using the bot you must agree with [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) as well.
