# Privacy Policy
[Trophy Bot](https://github.com/AntikoreDev/trophy-bot) does **not** save any personal info about you, and can't read messages from users anyway.

## What data is handled by Trophy Bot?
[Trophy Bot](https://github.com/AntikoreDev/trophy-bot) handles custom commands to receive data and general use of the bot. Any data you send to these commands are
handled by the bot, but **not** all data is stored.

## What data is stored by Trophy Bot?
[Trophy Bot](https://github.com/AntikoreDev/trophy-bot) stores data about trophies you create and award. That data includes every parameter you give to the trophy, such as the name, emoji, description etc, this is required in order to the proper work for the bot.
Images are also stored to prevent automatic Discord removal which would break the purpose of having good thumbnails for trophies. Removing a trophy will also remove any data about it including the thumbnail from the servers without persistence.<br>

Awards and rewards are also stored to make the bot work properly, this means that some user IDs and role IDs are also saved.<br> 

Trophies are per-server, and the Server ID is saved to be linked to every content created with the bot.<br>

When the bot handles an exception, it sends info about the error, including the command itself.

## What data is visible for others?
[Trophy Bot](https://github.com/AntikoreDev/trophy-bot) works per server, and there is no way for other server to see trophies on yours, and no way to share any content between servers apart from the total trophy count and award count in the `/stats` command.

## How can I remove my data?
Kicking the bot from your server won't remove any data stored for your server from it, for security reasons, but you can remove all of the data for your server including images using the command `/forgetme` without persistence (this will kick the bot itself too).
This command is only enabled to be performed by the server owner, to avoid malicious behaviour.

Any other questions you have about this, ask freely on the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/kNmgU44xgU)
